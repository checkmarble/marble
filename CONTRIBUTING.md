# How to contribute to Marble

## Did you find a bug?

- **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Marble**, and instead to refer to our security policy.

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/checkmarble/marble/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/checkmarble/marble/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information (including screenshots, if useful) as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- If the bug is a non-trivial one, consider reaching out to the Marble team to discuss at a high level how you intend to fix it

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Suggest your change in the devs@checkmarble.com mailing list, and get feedback on the general idea and the implementation plan

- Once a design has been validated, start writing code.

- Make sure your code works and does what it's expected to do on your end - if possible, add relevant test cases

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Ask any question about how to use Marble in the devs@checkmarble.com mailing list.
