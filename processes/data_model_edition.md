# Data model edition
You can add as many fields, tables, or relations as needed directly from Marble. However, to delete any of these elements, youâ€™ll need to make the changes directly in your Marble PostgreSQL database.

BE AWARE : removing fields or objects used in existing scenarios may generate errors and crashes. Do not remove fields and objects use in a scenario without also deleting the scenario. 

## Delete a table
**1. Find the table**
Get your table id with:
```
select *`
from data_model_tables as t
where t.name = 'your_table_name'
```
**2. Check that the table is not used in any links**
```
select *
from data_model_links
where parent_table_id='table_id' or child_table_id='table_id'
```
If any links are found, **delete the link**:
`delete from data_model_links where id='link_id'`

**3. Delete the table from your data model**
`delete from data_model_tables where id='table_id'`

**4. Delete the actual table**
Find your table in `org-{orgName}.{yourTableName}`
Then drop it: 
`drop table org-{orgName}.{yourTableName}`

## Delete a field
**1. Find the field**
Get your field id with:
```
select *
from data_model_tables as t
inner join data_model_fields as f on (f.table_id=t.id)
where t.name = 'your_table_name'
```
**2. Check that the table is not used in any links**
```
select *
from data_model_links
where parent_field_id='field_id' or child_field_id='field_id'
```
If any links are found, **delete the link**:
`delete from data_model_links where id='link_id'`

**3. Delete the field from your data model**
`delete from data_model_fields where id='field_id'`

**4. Delete the actual field in the table**
Find your table in `org-{orgName}.{yourTableName}`
Then drop the field:  
`alter table org-{orgName}.{yourTableName} drop
column {yourFieldName}`
